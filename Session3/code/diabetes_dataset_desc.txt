# Diabetes dataset

- 442 samples
- Consists of 10 features and 1 target

## Features

- Age
- Sex
- Body mass index
- Average blood pressure
- S1, S2, ... S6 -> these are blood serum measurement

N.B. All features have been standardized :
for each feature, we compute the mean and standard deviation
then for each sample and for each feature, 
we subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation
of the relevant feature.

This is why Age is not an integer.

## Target

This is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline
